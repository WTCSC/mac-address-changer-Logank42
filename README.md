# Mac Address Changer Shell Version:
## Features:
In this mac address changer, you have a couple of options. You can use your own mac address that you input, or a random one generated. This script does not save your mac address and you cannot recover a previous mac address unless it is saved elsewhere.
## How to use:
To use, you must enter the network interface of the mac address you want changed. After you do that, there are two options that you can use.

You can use the -r command, which will generate you a random mac address, or you can enter your own mac address in this format: 'xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx'.

An example of a valid input would be 'enp0s3 -r' or 'enp0s3 02:a4:2d:9f:09:cc'. If not entered in this format, you will recive an error message.

Enjoy!
